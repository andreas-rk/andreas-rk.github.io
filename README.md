# Metadaddy
Very homemade tool, which makes it easier to prepare photos to be used for end-user support (e.g. help centers).

Select a photo, and save a copy without the metadata, downscaled and reduced in size.

If you've selected a jpeg/jpg, you can set a custom DateTimeOriginal EXIF tag (which can be nice for testing purposes).

## How To Use
**1)** Select a photo (jpg/png)

**2) [Optional and only available for jpeg/jpg]** Set a custom DateTimeOriginal date

**3)** Save the photo
