Not meant to be used by the public. This was made for a very, very specific situation.
Further, the tool is very buggy, and I am too lazy to fix it.

A web-based tool to run photos through before sharing them with the world (e.g. in help center articles, macros etc.).

Select a photo, and save a copy without all the exif data, downscaled and reduced in size.

If you've selected a jpeg/jpg, you can even set a custom DateTimeOriginal EXIF tag.

#### Thanks to exif.js and piexif.js


## How To Use
**1)** Select a photo (jpg/png)

**2) [Optional and only available for jpeg/jpg]** Set a custom DateTimeOriginal date

**3)** Save the photo
